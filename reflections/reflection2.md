## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to connect our backend and frontend for with the API we are using, which brings us close to our MVP!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We struggled with trying to get our information from the API to render on the page we wanted it to, but were were able to work through that! Also, we are refreming our styling choices, which is a work in a progress.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We completed all in our sprint backlog, which mainly included the API, conditional rendering, and designing certain pages. We will most likely make more progress on working with the backend and database on different pages. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Using the resources such as out instructors, mentors, and websites was really helpful in working with Prisma and also css with the lecture this week with one of the instructors. We will continue utilize out resources!

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We don't believe there are any tasks that are "at risk." A lot of the tasks feel very doable now that we have our API working with the application.
