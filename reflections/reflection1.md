## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

We saw a lot of progress on our front-end of our website, sticking to our project plan of spending our first week completely working on the UI of our project. We each got into the habit of using AGILE methodology and we figured out a git workflow that works best for us.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One of our largest challenges was using a new UI tool, Material UI. Previously we were all building and styling components from scratch. We decided to try out Material UI as it is a popular styling library used across the industry. At first we struggled to learn the syntax and implement it to what we had already developed. Once we got over this initial learning curve we saw that our application started to take more shape.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished the tasks in our initial sprint and we started adding tasks from our product backlog. Since we restructured our sprint plan midweek due to mentor feedback and realization that we had diverged from our original project plan, we found that the restructure helped us finish tasks quicker and with more direction.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Our initial worry was git workflow, once we got the optional lesson and some guidance from instructors we felt more comfortable with the process. Having instructor and mentor feedback on our user stories and sprint planning was really useful as they helped us make some corrections and tips for a better plan. As for specific tools we used, our personal research was really useful as well as talking with other groups or professionals that have used these tools before. Showcasing our progress during Pod Syncs also gave us confidence in the direction of our project.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There were a few stories that we scrapped this week just because we noticed that they were out of the scope of our product. We have defined our MVP really well and will complete it by the end of next week. After we plan to start implementing our stretch features we have been laying foundations to make it possible to implement these features. If more user stories remain at risk, we will scrap them as long as we are comfortable with the progress of our MVP and the stretch features we are working on.
