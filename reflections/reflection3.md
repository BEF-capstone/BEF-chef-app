## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to compelete our MVP as well as a stretch feature. We also refactores some of the design for better user experience.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 There was a bug where the user id was undefined and we didn't know why. We later found that there was a typo issue.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were able to finish all our tasks in our sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 I think we mainly found our own resources to help us like the documentation for material UI and youtube videos on redux.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 At the moment, we don't have any features we would consider at risk. We will be able to implement our last stretch feature. As for user stories, were don't have any "at risk" user stories.
